# Android-Quad-Solutions-Trivia
## Hello and Welcome

Before running the project, you must have this spring boot app running https://github.com/meniman98/Quad-Solutions-Trivia

The app I've created is a short quiz, asking you 5 easy questions related to computer science. It retrieves those questions from the server app

I've used kotlin completely, and enjoyed using it very much. It's for sure the future. I used viewbinding, a snackbar, retrofit for my POST and GET request
